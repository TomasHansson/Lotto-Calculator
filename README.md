# Lotto-Calculator
A small project done during a C#/.NET course at Karlstads university.

A two part project - Lotto and Calculator.

• Lotto: Simulates the run of some lotto numbers and shows the result as 
numbers of runs with either 5, 6 or 7 matches as compared to the numbers
chosen by the user.

• Calculator: A fairly simple calculator that allows the user to make
calculations with the four basic numeric operators (/, *, -, +) and to 
repeat the previous operation on the result, if desired. Each equation is
between two numbers only.

What I Learned:
- The basics of Windows Forms.
- Handling basic events and input validation through Windows Forms.
